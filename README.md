asuswrt-merlin
==============

Firmware for the Asus AC-RT66U router.

About
-----
This is a fork of the final version of Merlin's legacy 380.xx firmware:

[https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.)

Objective
-----
This fork exists to patch security vulnerabilies in the 380.xx branch.

Warning
-----
I do not use many server features of this router, nor do I have a separate router for development, so I will not do exhaustive testing.  Use these patches at your own risk, and do not apply the firmware you build without having a firmware recovery tool available.
